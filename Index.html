                             <h3 style="color: crimson;"> Turbo Awakening: Just like Spryzen and Valtryek, Achilles can also enter the Turbo Awakened state. Turbo Breaker: When Attack 
                              Mode, Achilles uses its height to its advantage and attacks with the blade on its Layer, knocking the opposing Beyblade downward and dealing more damage.
                              Turbo Upper: This move is when one of the two swords hit the beyblade directly and is used to score a burst finish.Turbo Defense:Turbo Achilles uses the 
                              short blades on its Energy Layer to block attacks while dealing damage.Turbo Whip: Achilles hits the opponent's Bey head on, using its two blades to slash 
                              across the opponents bey, causing huge damage.Turbo Shield: When Achilles' balance falters, it uses the wobbling to aim the shield on the center of its energy 
                              layer at opposing Beys to deflect attacks. Achilles can also use this move while holding the center to block multiple attacks.Achilles channels its power into 
                              the long burst stopper blades on the Energy Layer to hit the opponent with a powerful sword like slash attack.Turbo Achilles uses the power from an opponent's 
                              attack to fly into the air. Using the gravity of the fall, it increases its speed and power to slam into an opponent from above, inflicting massive damage.</h3>
